Hi, I'm your host, <a href="http://kgriffs.com" title="About Kurt Griffiths" target="_blank">Kurt Griffiths</a>. Thanks for taking a look.

During my career I've had the opportunity to work in a wide variety of roles in such diverse fields as video game development, drivers, system utilities, Internet marketing, and cloud services. 

I believe that software is for humans, not the other way around. I believe that B work is bad for the soul. I believe in simple solutions to complex problems. I believe in individual responsibility and empowerment. I believe in doing what is right, especially when no one will find out. 

If you'd like to talk shop, or just say hi, here are a few places you can find me:
