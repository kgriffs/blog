<img src="/assets/images/mug.jpg" width='64px' height='64px' alt="Cloud Architect" class='left'/> Hi, I'm your host, <a href="http://kgriffs.com" title="About Kurt Griffiths" target="_blank">Kurt Griffiths</a>. I'm a cloud hacker and architect at Rackspace. I believe that software is for humans, not the other way around. I believe in elegant software that just works. I believe in simple solutions to complex problems. I believe that when something breaks, it should be easy to find the problem. I believe your time is better spent solving business problems, not babysitting systems.
