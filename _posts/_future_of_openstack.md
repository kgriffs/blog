As you may know, I am heavily involved in the OpenStack foundation. The promise of OpenStack has always been the democratization of web hosting. An open cloud makes it possible for hosting companies and IT departments to collaborate with web and mobile developers, in order to create best-fit solutions for each project. In fact, this abilility to transform customers into partners is one of my favorite things about OpenStack.

But let's face it. OpenStack is the underdog in the cloud market. The foundation has come a long way since those early days when NASA and Rackspace came together with two projects and a vision for a different kind of cloud. However, there is still plenty of work to be done to fully realize that vision.

OpenStack's story is really the story of anyone who sets out to challenge the status quo. To do what can't be done. To dream the impossible dream.

Allow me to share with you a personal experience.

It's early summer, 1996. I am 16 years old, discovering muscles I never thought existed, holding an unfortunately large baritone bugle to my lips. Every day, all day, I spend practicing with my corps, refining our field show for this year's season. My fellow drum corps friends surround me as we perform our drills, practice our steps, and perfect our music under an unforgiving blue summer sky.

During breaks we gossip about our corps, and about the competition. We talk about how everyone's field shows are shaping up, and who we think is going to rock the DCI finals at the end of the summer. As the season progresses, two drum corps begin to stand out in the rumor mill.

Everyone is talking about the Blue Devils and the Phantom Regiment.

The Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps is from Concord, CA. To date, they have won more trophies than any other DCI corps. They have a massive, multi-tiered organization. Many of their musicians move out to California in late spring to practice and take private lessons before the regular season starts. The Blue Devils' center snare is nicknamed "Jesus" because *he never makes a mistake*.

The Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps hails from Rockford, Illinois. Their show has been described as "boring" by many in the community because it eschews the flashy broadway style that has become prevelant in DCI over the past few seasons.

But lately, we start to hear how the Phantom Regiment is placing highly in competitions across the country, even taking first place in some cases. When people talk about the Phantom Regiment now, words like "exciting", "powerful" and "precise" are used.

[some tidbits about the show, maybe links to youtube clips, although doesn't do the sound justice.]

When the Blue Devils and the Phantom Regiment meet at the DCI 1996 World Championships in Orlando, Florida they finish their individual shows to thunderous applause. It is clear that we just witnessed something extraordinary. It isn't long before we learn the judge's decision. For the first time, there is a tie for first place in the world's premier drum and bugle corps competition.

As is traditional, both corps play a standing encore of their shows. I am standing in the first row of bleachers in front of the musicians listening to one of the most exhilirating performances I will ever hear in my lifetime. Although two corps were officially proclaimed that year's champions, there was only one in my mind as I walked away from those bleachers: The Phantom Regiment.

I will never forget what the Phantom Regiment taught me that summer.

## Lesson #1: Es Sprit de Corps ##

to the end.

don't underestimate the power...

## Lesson #2: Obsess Over the Basics ##

practice, focus efforts on smaller set of skills, features.

## Lesson #3: Create Your Own Market ##

There was a tie - very different shows, catering to different audiences... room for >1 winner.

When you are the underdog, your only chance of winning is to become obsessed with the basics. What lies at the heart of your business?
