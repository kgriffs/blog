When married with an open-source model, the cloud brings businesses and service providers together as partners in creating best-fit solutions that put people in the center, not software. 

"The Cloud" is not a **simple re-branding** of the old thin client architecture (ala Sun Ray). By contrast, cloud computing promotes the idea of running human-centric apps on powerful mobile devices.

Microsoft has been promoting this sort of "smart client" and "smart device" approach for years, but it never really took off until Apple married the idea of connected apps with powerful hardware that **embraced the internet** as a first-class citizen. The real breakthrough, however, was when Apple put **people** at the center of their ecosystem, not **software**.

The cloud movement has significantly changed the nature of applications. In the past, we were forced to mold our lives around the computer. Now, the computer molds itself around us. Modern computing is for humans, not the other way around.

Let's not let IT marketers and silver-tongued salespeople trick us into changing for change's sake. Let's not let them turn the cloud into just another gimmick. 

Instead, let's embrace the cloud in order to raise the bar on software development&mdash;in order to create the kinds of elegant, efficient, scalable systems that will carry us into the next great era of human civilization. The kinds of systems that mold themselves around people, not the other way around.

Maybe that sounds like hyperbole. But look what software has already done for the world! And we are just getting started...
