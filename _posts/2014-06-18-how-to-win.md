Allow me to share with you a personal experience.

It's early summer, 1996. I am 16 years old, discovering muscles I never thought existed, holding a heavy baritone bugle in front of my body for interminable lengths of time. Every day, all day, I spend practicing with my corps, refining our field show for this year's season. My fellow drum corps friends surround me as we perform our drills, practice our steps, and perfect our music under an unforgiving summer sky.

During breaks we gossip about our corps, and about the competition. We talk about how everyone's shows are shaping up, and who we think is going to rock the DCI finals at the end of the summer. As the season progresses, two drum corps begin to stand out in the rumor mill.

Everyone is talking about the Blue Devils and the Phantom Regiment.

The Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps is from Concord, CA. To date, they have won more trophies than any other DCI corps. They have a massive, tiered organization. Many of their musicians move out to California in late spring to practice and take private lessons before the regular season starts.

The Blue Devils' center snare is nicknamed "Jesus" because *he never makes a mistake*.

The Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps hails from Rockford, Illinois. Their show has been described as "boring" by many in the community because it eschews the flashy Broadway style that has become popular among many DCI corps over the past few seasons.

But lately, we start to hear the Phantom Regiment is placing highly in competitions across the country, even taking first in some cases. When people talk about the Phantom Regiment now, words like "exciting", "powerful" and "precise" are used. The corps is building a fervent fan base, with a serious show that captures the heart of what it means to be a drum and bugle corp.

When the Blue Devils and the Phantom Regiment meet in Florida for the DCI 1996 World Championships, they finish their individual shows to thunderous applause. It is clear to everyone that we have seen something extraordinary. It isn't long before we learn the judge's decision. For the first time, **there is a tie** for first place in the DCI finals.

Traditionally, the winner of the show arranges themselves at center field to play a standing encore of the music from their show. This year is no different, only better. Instead of just one encore performance, there are two. Here I am, standing in the first row of bleachers, experiencing two of the most powerful, exhilarating performances I will ever hear in my life.

I will never forget what the Phantom Regiment taught me that summer.

1. **Es Sprit de corps.** Don't underestimate the importance of creating a positive, constructive culture. A culture where every individual's contribution is valued. A culture of friendship, respect, and accountability.
1. **Obsess over the basics.** When you are the underdog, your only chance of winning is to become obsessed with the basics. Prioritize quality over quantity; substance over flash.
1. **Create your own fans.** There is more than one way to win. Decide who you're playing for, and then create something that blows them away. Play for your fans, not your competition.

What does this story have to do with you? Set audacious goals. Don't settle for mediocrity. "That's the way we've always done it" is a poor excuse. In 1998 the Phantom Regiment won against all odds. You can too.
