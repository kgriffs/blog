title: Cloud Scaling Anti-patterns or Painless Scaling, scale early, scale often
summary: Scaling your web app or service is a nice problem to have.  When, the runway has some potholes you will want to avoid.

Scaling your app or service is often described as "a nice problem to have," and "something you should worry about later if/when it happens." There seems to be no scaling problem that can't be solved by a few weeks of sleepless nights and Rockstar-fueled hackathons. The trouble is, weeks have a tendency to turn into months, and architecting for scale just-in-time is costly and has a tendency to create fragile, keeps coming up, never done, partially true.

  decisions have a way of coming back from the dead again and again. [Talk about three ways to make scaling less painful if you are lucky enough to have such a nice problem.]

# 3 - 5 points

* Don't Reinvent the Wheel
* Scale out, not up
* Cloud Hosting === Scalable
* Can't anticipate
  * hosting provider can scale with you, metrics, testing, fire drill
  * my app never crash
* Too costly

having to work for three days straight to swap out half your system when and then pass out under your desk to swap out half your system when suddenly that 'nice problem' falls into your lap

Startups that follow this advice and survice to make it big like to tell war stories, based on their experiences having to scale their systems at a moment's notice. While

explaining how, for example, everything went to heck at 3am one Thursday morning, and they had less than 1 hour to swap out half their system or die. Such

While such stories are fun to hear and make for a good tech talk, certainly entertaining, and virtually guarantee a spot on Hacker News, are experiences like these an inevitable consequence of success?

cost, scaling is expensive, planning for scalability from the beginning is expensive, requires too much expertise.


don't reinvent the wheel

out, not up? maybe.

HTTP is too slow

we can do devops later

we can clean up this code later

early testing, benchmarking, we have no idea what real usage is like

my app will never crash

I can always scale up

don't worry about provider

The Cloud(tm) will not save you -- this hot new tech will save us - when your app goes viral, noone can save you. Noone has had this specific problem before.

iterate, but be flexible, etc.

Fallacy: embrace technical debt... VC mindset? Much riskier... At mininum, much more painful.
