Occasionally I'll share a "Cloud Watch" newsletter of sorts, with interesting links that I've come across.

Enjoy!

# Food for Thought #

**[How to Choose Colors Proceduraly][1]**. This tutorial demonstrates how to automatically generate colors that look happy together. Use this approach to dress up your crayon graphs, control panels, and dashboards. While not mentioned in the article, procedural color generation is possible even in CSS. All you need is a preprocessor that understands math, such as LESS or SASS.

**[Building a Faster Web][10]**. I have it [on good authority][4] that [SPDY][3] will be the starting point for the IETF's next big project, *HTTP 2.0*. The new standard is going to be a binary protocol, with optional TLS. Watch for a rough draft early next year.

**[Enterprise Integration Patterns][2]**. Use this site as an online reader's digest of the book by the same name. EIP offers a good summary of message bus patterns and terminology, which you can use to win friends and influence enterprises.

**[Node.js vs PHP: Fight!][8]**. Node is usually faster at serving web requests than other scripting languages. This blog post pits Node.js against PHP running under Apache, and provides an excellent excuse to use a slightly less-horrible language for web apps (and there was much rejoicing).

# The Open Cloud #

**[Anvil][5]**. Deploying OpenStack has always been a royal pain. Anvil comes to the rescue.

**[Logging as Event Streams][13]**. Check out this slide deck from an OSCON talk to find out how the Cloud Monitoring team @ Rackspace does logging.

**[Qpid][QPID]**. Think of it as a new and improved RabbitMQ. Except it scales. And it is written in a language that mere mortals can understand.

**[HP Offers 'That Cloud Thing Everyone is Talking About'][12]**. HP's recently-announced public cloud is based on OpenStack. The Onion puts it's own spin on the story.

# Community

**[Stream and Record Google+ Hangouts][6]**. Great for broadcasting your next tech-talk or just making a fool of yourself on YouTube. Pirate hats, arr!

**[Programmer Moneyball][9]**. Insightful article written by someone who knows a thing or two about buzzwords, and how useful they are in identifying candidates for your open positions.

**[Vanilla Forums][11]**. At Rackspace we just started using Vanilla for our internal forums. Vanilla is an attractive, modern alternative to phpBB.
