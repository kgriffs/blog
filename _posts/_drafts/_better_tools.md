**[Better Tools][typescript]**. Don't be afraid to be a creator. My Grandfather was a carpenter. If he didn't have the right tool for the job, he made one. If the tool he had didn't work well enough, he rolled up his sleeves and fixed it. JavaScript is one of those things that [needs to be fixed][typescript]. Imagine what you could build with better tools.

Best tool for the job: if they all suck, build your own.
