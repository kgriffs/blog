There’s an interesting interplay between a person’s:

* Desire to be productive (E)
* Appreciation for security (S)
* Faith in leadership (F)
* Pain threshold for security measures (T)

Where a person’s security threshold is equal to some measure of the other
three:

    T = E + S + F 

If you want to improve your organization's security posture, you won't
have much success unless you work *with* your people, instead of *against*
them. You need to sit down with them to find out what a day in their life
is like. Take the time to understand not just their workflows, but also their
concerns and motiviations.

Then, you'll need to create an equilibrium between each individual's security 
threshold and the pain (P) induced by the sum of all security measures
deployed

    T ≈ sum(P<sub>0</sub>...P<sub>n-1</sub>)


 . Ideally, we design solutions that minimize the pain[1], such
that the threshold does not have to be very high in most[2] cases. On the
other hand, it would certainly be helpful to improve Rackers’ appreciation
for security and their faith and trust in leadership. I think we need to
tackle this issue from both angles.

As Major pointed out, it is hard to get people to care more about security
unless the’ve been burned in the past. You either learn by your own
experience why it’s important, or you decide to trust someone else’s
experience. One way that I’ve seen this work is by utilizing people’s
sense of tribes. Suppose you have a group that contains a 1-2 security
“champions” who are also respected leaders and mentors within said group.
If I look up to Susan and Susan cares about security, I’m more likely to
care about security myself. But I think the larger the group, the more
this effect is diluted. E.g., Brian Kelly can beat the drum all day long,
but Joe Racker who doesn’t know Brian very well (or at all) isn’t going to
get very pumped about security. Especially if nobody asked him before
rolling something out that made is job a PITA.

Anyway, we need to figure out how we as TCT members can make a difference,
and then go do that. :)
