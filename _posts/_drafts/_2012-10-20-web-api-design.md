What makes a good API? How do you prove your implementation does the right thing, and does it right? Here are three articles<sup><a name="id-1" href="#id-1.ftn">1</a></sup> of recent<sup><a name="id-2" href="#id-2.ftn">2</a></sup> articles, videos, and websites on the subject. 

# Affordances and Elegant APIs #

In 1986, James J. Gibson coined the term "affordance." He theorized that the survival and success of an animal within it's environment depends on it's ability to take advantage of that environment's affordances. Wikipedia defines the term thus:

    An affordance is a quality of an object, or an environment, that allows an individual to perform an action.


Donald A. Norman's later expounded on the idea of affordances in a way that is particularly interesting in the realm of API design:

    The value of a well-designed object is when it has such a rich set of affordances that the people who use it can do things with it that the designer never imagined.

Further clarified in a [1999 essay][essay]:

    Affordances reflect the possible relationships among actors and objects: they are properties of the world.
