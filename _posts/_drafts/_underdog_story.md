It's early summer, 1996. I am 16 years old, discovering muscles I never thought existed, holding an unfortunately large baritone bugle to my lips. Every day, all day, I spend practicing with my corps, refining our field show for this year's season. My fellow drum corps friends surround me as we perform our drills, practice our steps, and perfect our music under an unforgiving blue summer sky.

During breaks we gossip about our corps, and about the competition. We talk about how everyone's field shows are shaping up, and who we think is going to rock the DCI finals at the end of the summer. As the season progresses, two drum corps begin to stand out in the rumor mill.

Everyone is talking about the Blue Devils and the Phantom Regiment.

The Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps is from Concord, CA. To date, they have won more trophies than any other DCI corps. They have a massive, multi-tiered organization. Many of their musicians move out to California in late spring to practice and take private lessons before the regular season starts. The Blue Devils' center snare is nicknamed "Jesus" because *he never makes a mistake*.

The Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps hails from Rockford, Illinois. Their show has been described as "boring" by many in the community because it eschews the flashy broadway style that has become prevelant in DCI over the past few seasons.

But lately, we start to hear how the Phantom Regiment is placing highly in competitions across the country, even taking first place in some cases. When people talk about the Phantom Regiment now, words like "exciting", "powerful" and "precise" are used.

[some tidbits about the show, maybe links to youtube clips, although doesn't do the sound justice.]

When the Blue Devils and the Phantom Regiment meet at the DCI 1996 World Championships in Orlando, Florida they finish their individual shows to thunderous applause. It is clear that we just witnessed something extraordinary. It isn't long before we learn the judge's decision. For the first time, there is a tie for first place in the world's premier drum and bugle corps competition.

As is traditional, both corps play a standing encore of their shows. I am standing in the first row of bleachers in front of the musicians listening to one of the most exhilirating performances I will ever hear in my lifetime. Although two corps were officially proclaimed that year's champions, there was only one in my mind as I walked away from those bleachers: The Phantom Regiment.

I will never forget what the Phantom Regiment taught me that summer.
