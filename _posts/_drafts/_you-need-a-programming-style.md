Programming style guides are one of those things software developers love to hate. However, over the years I've become convinced that a well thought-out coding standard is *essential* to maintaining code bases of any significant size.

In your career you spend a lot more time reading code than actually writing it. Therefore, it is only prudent to put standards in place that safeguard readability. This is the first and most important role of any coding standard.

The second role of a coding style is to avoid common programming mistakes that happen just because of the way our brains work. It isn’t that we are stupid, just that we aren’t perfect. Every language has little quirks, and a good programming style helps work around them. The best style guides even anticipate and thwart issues that only manifest as an artifact of long-term code maintenance.

Finally, the third role of a coding style is to avoid wasting time bikeshedding on topics like whether to use tabs or spaces, and where the curly bracket should be placed. You have bigger fish to fry.

Programming standards serve a similar purpose to prose guides, such as *The Elements of Style* and *The Chicago Manual of Style*. Both programming and prose style guides prevent arguments over minutiae, make your writing more accessible to others outside your immediate group, and ensure your intent is clearly communicated to the reader.
