Programming style guides are one of those things software developers love to hate. However, over the years I've become convinced that a well thought-out coding standard is *essential* to maintaining code bases of any significant size. A good standard will save your team time, make your code more readable, and help even experienced devs avoid common pitfalls. 

As a software engineer, I spend a lot more time reading code than actually writing it. I think this is true for a lot of people. Ergo, it's really important to write code that is *meant* to be read. Not just next week, but next month, next year, and even 10 years from now. This is the first and most important role of any coding standard.

The second role of a proper coding style is to help us avoid common programming mistakes. Every language has its share of snares, tripping up beginners and veterans alike. Over time, the community discovers pathways around these snares and catalogues them as "idioms". Such workarounds are an important part of any coding standard.

Finally, a good coding standard puts to rest silly arguments that are only so much wasted time and energy. This includes super important questions such as: How wide should my tabs be? Where should I place my curly brackets? Should I use TitleCamelCase, camelCase, lower_underscore_case, or STOPMYEYESAREBLEEDINGCASE?

Programming standards serve a similar purpose to prose standards, such as *The Elements of Style* and *The Chicago Manual of Style*. Both programming and prose style guides prevent arguments over minutiae, make your writing more accessible to others outside your immediate group, and ensure your intent is clearly communicated to the reader.
