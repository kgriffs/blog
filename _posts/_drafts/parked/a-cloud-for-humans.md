The cloud movement is a key enabler in the revolutionary change from "desktops and applications" to "devices and apps". In fact, if not for Apple's pioneering work in the mobile space, the market for cloud services would have been far smaller. 

It allows our compute and information to travel with us wherever we go. It frees us from worrying about backups and other mundane things. It helps make the computer invisible, putting the focus on us, our human relationships, and our goals.

Let's not let IT marketers and silver-tongued salespeople trick us into changing for change's sake. Let's not let them turn the cloud into just another gimmick. 

Instead, let's embrace the cloud in order to raise the bar on software development&mdash;in order to create the kinds of elegant, efficient, scalable systems that will carry us into the next great era of human civilization. The kinds of systems that mold themselves around people, not the other way around.

Maybe that sounds like hyperbole, but it's already happening. I wonder what the next big step in human-centered computing will be? Perhaps you will be the one to create it.
