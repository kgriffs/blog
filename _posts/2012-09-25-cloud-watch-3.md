I've been playing with Node.js lately. Does it show?

*Cloud Watch is a little newsletter of mine that showcases relevant posts on software and cloud engineering, lovingly collected in one place for your viewing pleasure.*

# Node Style #

**[Essential Node Style][essential-style]**. Caolan McMahon, of [Async][async] fame, provides some well-thought-out tips on writing maintainable Node apps. 

**[Callback Hell][cbh]**. Check out this guide to avoiding the most notorious gotcha of Node programming, lovingly referred to in blog posts and podcasts as *Callback Hell*. 

**[Stream Handbook][streams]**. Stream-oriented programming can make your programs more elegant and easier to maintain. Check out Substack's handbook on effective stream programming. He updates the handbook often, keep a watch on the repo for new content. If you like what you see, check out [Strata][strata], the elegant, stream-friendly web framework.

# Node Book #

**[Smashing Node.js](http://www.amazon.com/Smashing-Node-js-JavaScript-Everywhere-Magazine/dp/1119962595)**. Check out this new book on Node.js from the inventor of *Socket.IO*. Guillermo covers the entire Node ecosystem, including protocols, frameworks, databases, and tests.

# Node Tools #

**[Expect + Node = Suppose][node-suppose]**. Use JP Richardson's *Suppose* module to automate tedious CLI tasks ala the ever faithful [expect][expect].

**[Using the Node Debugger][node-debug]**. Several outdated and incorrect node debugging tutorials on the web come up in search results ahead of the official documentation. Do yourself a favor and go straight to the source. 

**[Fancy Node Debugging][node-inspector]**. If GUI debugging is more your style, you'll love Danny Coates' *Node Inspector*.

# Node Realtime #

**[Redis <3 Lua](http://redis.io/commands/eval)**. Lua seems to be popping up all over the place these days. [Redis 2.6](http://redis.io/download) will exit RC status soon, and comes with Lua superpowers. Learn all about it at [RedisConf](http://www.redisconf.com/).

**[Draw with Me](http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2012/08/nodejs-drawing-game/)**. What writeup on Node would be complete without a realtime app demo? Give this one a try. It's a lot of fun. :D
