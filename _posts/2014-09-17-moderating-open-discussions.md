Discussing things "in the open" is important. But it does not necessarily engender trust in a community, especially in the absence of cognizant moderation.

I'm thinking about setting up a mailing list for the [Falcon web framework][1]. This seems like a good way to capture tribal knowledge. IRC is great for quick questions and discussions, but not everyone has a bouncer, and even then it can be difficult to catch people online depending on the time of day.

But I have a concern. Mailing lists tend to dehumanize people, opening the door to subconscious (and conscious) social behaviors that are anything but constructive. I've seen this happen first-hand in other communities I've been a part of.

Here's a rough list of ways to interact with people, from most human to least:

1. In-person visits
2. Video conferencing
3. Phone calls
4. Instant messaging
5. Mailing lists

Don't get me wrong; mailing lists can be (and have been) used for much good. It's just that the further down you get on the list above, the more discipline is required to keep communications constructive. 

Part of the problem is that mailing lists (and other forums that facilitate open discussions) can sometimes lead to a culture of distrust. This happens when individuals in power publicly humiliate, intimidate, or even bully others in the community. Often this happens unconsciously or as a result of a poor choice of words. Regardless of whether the intent is actual or perceived, the damage to the community is the same, and must be quickly dealt with before it festers into a culture of enmity.

Once the Falcon mailing list is live, it will be interesting to see how this plays out and how much moderation ends up being required. So far the community has been really cool and I don't want to lose that.
