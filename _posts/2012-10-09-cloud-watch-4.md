Cultivating personal leadership and a habit of innovation is essential for any software team wanting to remain relevant. See below for a roundup<sup><a name="id-1" href="#id-1.ftn">1</a></sup> of recent<sup><a name="id-2" href="#id-2.ftn">2</a></sup> articles, videos, and websites on the subject. 

# Innovation #

**[Back][speech] to the [Future][venus]**. When I think about innovation, I think about Steve Jobs and Jacque Frescho<sup><a name="id-23" href="#id-3.ftn">3</a></sup>. Check out Steve's speech from 1983, where he foreshadowed today's connected, mobile world. Next, head on over to Mr. Frescho's site. His Venus Project will blow your mind. These two luminaries changed the world by looking past today's constraints to discover tomorrow's possibilities.

**[The Patent Game][patents-1]**. Our current patent system in the U.S. is a goldmine for patent trolls. We need to fix our system so that patents don't hinder innovation, but encourage it&mdash;as originally intended. Rackspace [has a fix][troll-pay] in mind. What else can we do? (See also Judge Richard Posner's [thoughts on the matter][patents-2].)

**[Inventing on Principle][principle]**. Creating great software and amazing experiences isn't a random exercise. Many entrepreneurs get lucky the first time, and spend the rest of their lives trying to do it again. The anecdote? Principles. Understanding what drives it all leads to repeatable success. Follow the link to watch Brett Victor demonstrate the power of *inventing on principle*.

**[Incentives and Creativity][pink]** You may have seen Dan Pink's  TED talk already, but it's worth reviewing regularly, especially if you are a team lead or dev manager.

# Personal Leadership #

**[Re-imagining Microsoft.com][new-msft]**. Follow the link to get the skinny on the new Microsoft.com. Nishant writes about the importance of leadership, attitude, and guts in crafting an awesome user experience.

**[Hire '<span class="mono">I</span>' People][hire-i-people]**. Bill Buxton argues that the best engineers are well-rounded thinkers and communicators. Bill posits that we should be looking for people who not only have technical depth in one area, but are also good at juggling both the **practical** and **abstract** aspects of software design. (See also Ted Spence's post on [Programmer Moneyball][moneyball].)

**[The Leader Who Had No Title][no-title]**. Watch this great video introducing Robin Sharma's theory of leadership. If you like what you see, the book is even better. You should check it out<sup><a name="id-4" href="#id-4.ftn">4</a></sup>.

<ul class="footnotes">
  <li>
    <sup><a name="id-1.ftn" href="#id-1">1</a></sup> Cloud Watch is a little newsletter of mine that showcases relevant posts on software and cloud engineering, lovingly collected in one place for your viewing pleasure. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <sup><a name="id-2.ftn" href="#id-2">2</a></sup> Well, <i>mostly</i> recent. For completeness, I pulled in a few links to some older stuff. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <sup><a name="id-3.ftn" href="#id-3">3</a></sup> My first encounter with Jacque Frescho's work came in the form of some mind-blowing architectural renderings that my older brother had posted on his bedroom wall. Years later, I came across <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Future_by_Design/70101466?trkid=2361637">an awesome documentary</a> that tells Jacque's story. Highly recommended.

  <li>
    <sup><a name="id-4.ftn" href="#id-4">4</a></sup> I prefer the audio version of the book, since it's a business novel (in the spirit of The Goal). You can probably find the CDs at your local library.
