Cultivating personal leadership and a habit of innovation is essential for any software team wanting to remain relevant.

*Cloud Watch is a little newsletter of mine that showcases relevant posts on software and cloud engineering, lovingly collected in one place for your viewing pleasure.*

# Personal Leadership #

**[New Microsoft(.com)][new-msft]**. "My favorite part of this project? Leadership. This project, more than any other I've been a part of, had leadership. Not management, but leadership." Check out this insightful retrospective on Microsoft's recent overhaul of their web presence. 

**[Hire 'I' People][hire-i-people]**. Bill Buxton argues that we should focus less on hiring along a specific skill axis, and more on general thinking skills. Bill posits that we should be looking for people who have technical depth in one area, but also people who are good at thinking about both the practical and abstract attributes of software design. In other words, look for thought leaders. (See also Ted Spence's post on [Programmer Moneyball][moneyball].)

**[The Leader Who Had no Title][no-title]**. This is a great introductory video into Robin Sharma's theory of leadership. If you like what you see, the book is even better. You should check it out.

# Innovation #

**[Back to the Future][speech]** No one is more familiar with making innovation a habit than Steve Jobs. Check out this speech from 1983, where he foreshadowed today's connected, mobile world. Force yourself to look past the constraints of today and discover what is possible tomorrow.

**[The Patent Game][patents-1]**. Our current patent system in the U.S. is a goldmine for patent trolls. We need to fix it so that patents don't hinder innovation, but encourage it&mdash;as originally intended. (See also Judge Richard Posner's [thoughts on the matter][patents-2].)

**[Better Tools][typescript]**. Don't be afraid to be a creator. My Grandfather was a carpenter. If he didn't have the right tool for the job, he made one. If the tool he had didn't work well enough, he rolled up his sleeves and fixed it. JavaScript is one of those things that needs to be fixed.
