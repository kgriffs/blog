When it comes to web services, latency and efficiency matters. The last thing you want is your web framework to bottleneck you API. Previously, I shared some performance testing results involving a queuing message service using a custom web micro-framework, Rawr. Several of you asked about getting the code for Rawr, and so I'm happy to announce that it's successor has been open-sourced courtesy of Rackspace. 

Falcon is a new, [high-performance framework][home] for building web services and cloud APIs. It's WSGI-based, and works great with Python 2.7, Python 3.3, and PyPy, giving you a wide variety of deployment options. While [the project][source] is still quite young (v0.1.0 at the time of this writing), it's far enough along to be useful in real applications.
