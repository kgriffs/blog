Cloud computing is the Next Big Thing&trade; and this blog helps software developers sort it all out.

# You Should Read this Stuff #

The cloud matters. A lot. Cloud hosting turns hardware *into* software. Rather than viewing utility computing as simply serving operating systems to thin hardware devices, cloud computing promotes the idea of running thin apps on powerful, mobile devices.

Microsoft has been promoting this sort of "smart client" approach for years, but it never really took off until Apple married the idea of connected apps with a powerful, impeccably designed hardware platform and operating system that embraced the internet as a first-class citizen.

The cloud movement completely changes the game of application development. Apps are no longer serfs hiding inside inpeneratable castles. You've now got to design connected agents, personal assistants, and social butterflies. And it all has to be elastic and scalable.

# More Stuff on the Way #

As a cloud architect and hacker at Rackspace, I've become convinced that we are only at the beginning of a long journey. From the infrastructure to the apps, and everything in between, we can't just continue building things the way we have in the past. The cloud really *is* a very different way of thinking about the world of computing. We still have a whole lot of experimentation and discovery ahead of us.

I'd like to invite you along on my personal journey to make sense of it all and discover the best ways to go about constructing systems for the next great era in computing.
